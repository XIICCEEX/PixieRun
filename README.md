# PixieRun
In Pixie Run, players take on the role of a tiny fairy dashing through enchanting fantasy worlds filled with poisonous mushrooms and mysterious forests. The main objective is to score as high as possible by running continuously, dodging obstacles, and collecting items along the way to boost points.

Players are equipped with a double jump ability, allowing them to overcome complex terrain and evade hazards more easily. As the game progresses, floating enemies appear to attack the player, increasing both the difficulty and the excitement of each run.

Pixie Run offers a fast-paced, magical adventure where timing, agility, and precision are key to surviving and setting new high scores.
